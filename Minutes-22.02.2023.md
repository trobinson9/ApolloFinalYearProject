## Topics Discussed
Image analysis  

## Details
Current use of CLIP from DALL.E model to compare similarity between images and text (eg Title)  
Able to use model on data, still need to run on full dataset and analyse results  
Suggestion to also provide output text of Image to compare with text - more useful for user  

## Actions
Analyse results of CLIP model  
Apply more general image->text model 
Move focus to report writing in March
